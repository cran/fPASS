Description: Computes the power and sample size (PASS) required to test for the
    difference in the mean function between two groups under a repeatedly measured longitudinal 
    or sparse functional design. See the manuscript by Koner and Luo (2023) <https://salilkoner.github.io/assets/PASS_manuscript.pdf> 
    for details of the PASS formula and computational details. The details of the testing
    procedure for univariate and multivariate response are presented in
    Wang (2021) <doi:10.1214/21-EJS1802> and Koner and Luo (2023) 
    <arXiv:2302.05612> respectively.
